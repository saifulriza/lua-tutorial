## Running Lua programs

As explained in the Getting started chapters for [Linux](TODO), [Mac OS X](TODO), and [Windows](TODO), depending on your operating system and your personal preferences you can run your program by:

- Linux / terminal
- Windows / OS X / UI

You're invited to create a test Lua file and retype in there each snippet you'll find in this chapter and try it out to check how it works by running the file.
