## Comments

Comments are "programmer-readable annotation[s] in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier to understand, and are generally ignored" when runnning the program ([Wikipedia, Comment](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming)>))

Lua has single line and multiple line comments

```.lua
-- Two dashes start a one-line comment.

--[[
     Adding two ['s and ]'s makes it a
     multi-line comment.
--]]
```
