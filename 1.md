# Learning Lua

This introduction to Lua is a fast and furious overview of the main parts of Lua that you will need for creating your first game with Lua and LÃ–VE.

It's largely inspired by  [Learn Lua in 15 minutes](http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/) and it mainly focused on two type of readers:

- You already know other programming languages and just want to have a peek at what Lua looks like.
- You want to start as fast as possible to program the game and want to learn the language by doing it.

In both cases you will want to come back to this section each time you don't understand the code snippets for the game. If you don't find the answer in this chapter, you might want to have a look at the [Lua Manual](http://www.lua.org/manual/) or you might need a more gentle and didactical introduction to Lua.

If you want a more gently and didactical learning experience, you might want to read [Programming in Lua](http://www.lua.org/pil/) before further reading this manual.
